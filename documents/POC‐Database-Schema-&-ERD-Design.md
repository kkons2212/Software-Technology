# Database Schema & ERD Design (Smart Museum POC)


---

## 1. Database Architecture Overview

During the Proof of Concept (POC) phase, the system leverages **SQLite** configured in **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** mode with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;` to ensure:
- **High Performance & Non-blocking Concurrency:** Mobile visitor reads can occur simultaneously without being locked by backend write jobs (Google Translation & Edge-TTS synthesis background tasks).
- **Data Integrity:** Cascade deletion automatically cleans up related translations and audio records when a POI is deleted.
